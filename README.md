# Front-End for Backoffice #WirVsVirusHackathon

As part of the *#WirVsVirusHackathon* this project aims to provide the front-end of a web appilcation in order to implement a reservation system that can be used by both customers and supermarket employees to prevent long queue times.

## Motivation
Due to the coronavirus desease (COVID-19) pandemic with about 267 013 confirmed cases in 185 countries (WHO, 21 March 2020) the German government and seven iniatives initiated a hackathon from 20 March 2020 to 22 March 2020 where everyone interested was invited to support. In total 42 968 participants, 1924 patrons and 2922 mentors registered to tinker about problems that were submitted by the community.

## Project Description
This project is part of the challenge "Supermarket Status". The target group are the backoffice employees of the supermarkets. The employees can create an account for the supermarket which gives access to configure name and address of supermarket, opening hours and time slots (length, number of people per time slot, walk-in customers). Furthermore, employees will be able to check the validity of QR Codes customers get when choosing a time slot via the app.
